# Documentation App with Next.js

This is a documentation app built with Next.js. It is a simple app that displays a list of documentation items and allows users to view the details of each item. I have used react-markdown to render the markdown content of the documentation items. The app is styled with Tailwind CSS. It is a simple app that demonstrates how to build a documentation app with Next.js.
