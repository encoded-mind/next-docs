| **File-Based Routing**                    | Next.js uses a file-based routing system, making it easy to create routes by simply adding files to the `pages` or `app` directory. |
| **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**           | Automatically renders pages on the server to improve SEO and initial load performance.                                              |
| **Static Site Generation (SSG)**          | Generates static HTML at build time, offering faster load times and better performance.                                             |
| **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** | Allows for re-generation of static pages at runtime, ensuring content is always up-to-date.                                         |
| **API Routes**                            | Enables the creation of API endpoints within the Next.js application, eliminating the need for a separate backend.                  |
| **Automatic Code Splitting**              | Automatically splits code for faster page loads, only loading the necessary JavaScript for each page.                               |
| **CSS and Sass Support**                  | Built-in support for CSS and Sass, including CSS Modules for scoped styling.                                                        |
| **Fast Refresh**                          | Provides instant feedback and quick iterations during development by preserving the component state.                                |
| **Image Optimization**                    | Optimizes images by default, supporting responsive images, lazy loading, and more.                                                  |
| **TypeScript Support**                    | First-class support for TypeScript, enabling static typing and better code quality.                                                 |
| **Internationalization (i18n)**           | Built-in support for internationalized routing and language detection.                                                              |
